# intro_python_spatial_analytics
In this session we will learn how to use python with arcgis library (arcgis and arcpy) to do spatial data analytics for Riskesdas (Riset Kesehatan Dasar) data. To start the session, follow these steps:
1. Read "Python for Spatial Analytics.pdf"

In this part you will get the big idea of this session and learn how to setup a python environment either in your local computer or in the cloud using ArcGIS Online's Jupyter Notebook.

2. Read "Tabula Installation Procedure.pdf"

In second part you will learn how to install Tabula as tools to extract table from pdf file. Download the data here: http://dinkes.babelprov.go.id/sites/default/files/dokumen/bank_data/20181228%20-%20Laporan%20Riskesdas%202018%20Nasional-1.pdf

3. Extract the data on page 21 (Tabel 3.1.1 Proporsi Pengetahuan Rumah Tangga terhadap Kemudahan Akses ke Rumah Sakit menurut Provinsi, Riskesdas 2018) through Tabula and process the data either manually or you can use Python (use 'Geolytics - Python Spatial Data Analytics - Tabula-Py').

4. Open "Geospatial Python Spatial Analytics.ipynb" and follow the steps by running all the cells

At the end of this part you have joined the data from pdf file with the spatial data in shapefile (.shp) format. Congratulation!
